        <div class="col-xl-12 col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><p>Often I'm not so much talkative, tending to listen more than talk, unless I have the chance to talk about something that gets my attention and opinion. Actually, being there such a simple description of me, I think it is prove enough of the fact I tend to be minimal and do a small, accurate, well done content rather than one which is big, full of stuff but chaotic and which in the end could be reduced to a way simpler concept (not that I dislike it, it's just my usual way of doing stuff). I also tend to be quite strict and accurate when I work, or for example when I speak, although maybe I'm not always strict at 100% in everything, considering a bit of tolerance (it also may depend on the context).</p></div>
