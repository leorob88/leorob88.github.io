I think development just suits me, since I can be pretty strict and rational even in my frequent habits. Often I tend to speak with the same precision that I have when I create any kind of App or content of any sort. I think the best and most fun part of development is the time of creation, when you have a vision of something and eventually, slowly but surely, you see it coming to life!</p></div>
